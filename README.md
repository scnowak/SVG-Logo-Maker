## Overview

## The Challenge:
Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user inputs to generates a SVG logo and saves it as "Circle.svg" file. Code also has the functionality to create a "Square.svg" or "Triangle.svg". In addition, create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and the passing of all of the tests.


## User Story
```md
AS a web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters that will appear on logo
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's fill color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: square, circle, or triangle 
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `Circle.svg`
AND the output text "Generate logo  is WORKING!!" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `Circle.svg` file in live server or browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```
